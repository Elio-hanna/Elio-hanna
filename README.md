## ðŸ”­ What I'm currently working on
Currently, I am working on developing a backend API for a computer vision application. This involves designing and implementing a scalable architecture that can handle a large volume of image data. The primary goal is to build a high-performance API that can process and analyze images in real-time, while maintaining data accuracy and security. To achieve this, I am leveraging various machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques to develop advanced image processing pipelines that can handle various image formats and sizes. Overall, I am excited about the challenge of building a reliable and scalable backend API that can help deliver cutting-edge computer vision applications to users.
## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
I am currently focused on learning Java Spring Boot, a popular framework for building enterprise-level web applications. As a software engineer, it's essential to stay updated with the latest technologies and frameworks to create robust, scalable, and high-performing applications.
